<h1 id="study--learning-tips">5 Study / Learning Tips</h1>
<h2 id="write-it-out.">Write it out.</h2>
<p>Put those third-grade penmanship lessons to good use. <a href="http://www.intechopen.com/books/advances-in-haptics/digitizing-literacy-reflections-on-the-haptics-of-writing">Research suggests</a> we store information more securely when we write it out by hand than when we type it. Start by recopying the most important notes from the semester onto a new sheet of paper.</p>
<h2 id="space-it-out.">Space it out.</h2>
<p>A learning technique called “<a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2009/11/spaced-education-boosts-learning">spaced repetition</a>” involves breaking up information into small chunks and reviewing them consistently over a long period of time. So don’t try to memorize the entire periodic table in one sitting—instead learn a few rows every day and review each lesson before starting anything new.</p>
<h2 id="tell-a-tale.">Tell a tale.</h2>
<p>Turning the details you need to remember into a <a href="http://greatist.com/happiness/remember-everything/">crazy story</a> helps make the information more meaningful. For example, remember the order of mathematic operations <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html">PEMDAS</a> this way: Philip (‘P’) wanted to eat (‘E’) his friend Mary (‘M’) but he died (‘D’) from arsenic (‘AS’) poisoning.</p>
<h2 id="put-yourself-to-the-test.">Put yourself to the test.</h2>
<p>Quizzing ourselves may be one of the best ways to prepare for the real deal. And don’t worry about breaking a sweat while trying to remember the name of the 37th U.S. president (fyi, it’s Nixon): The harder it is to remember a piece of information in practice mode, the more likely we are to remember it in the future.</p>
<h2 id="doze-off.">Doze off.</h2>
<p>When there’s a textbook full of equations to memorize, it can be tempting to stay up all night committing them to memory (or trying to). But all-nighters rarely lead to an automatic A—in fact, they’ve been linked to impaired cognitive performance and <a href="http://greatist.com/happiness/tips-sleeping-better/">greater sensitivity to stress</a>. In the days leading up to a big exam, aim to get those seven to nine hours a night so sleep deprivation doesn’t undo all the hard work you’ve put in.</p>
<h2 id="nix-the-net.">Nix the 'net.</h2>
<p>We’ve all been there, facing the siren call of a friend’s Facebook wall on the eve of a giant exam. If a computer’s necessary for studying, try an app (such as <a href="http://selfcontrolapp.com/">this one</a>) that blocks the Internet for a short period of time and see how much more you get done.</p>
<h2 id="move-around.">Move around.</h2>
<p>Research suggests studying the same stuff in a different place every day makes us less likely to forget that information.  Every time we move around (from the library to the coffee shop or the coffee shop to the toilet seat), we force the brain to form new associations with the same material so it becomes a stronger memory.</p>
<h2 id="switch-it-up.">Switch it up.</h2>
<p>Don’t stick to one topic; instead, study a bunch of  <a href="http://uweb.cas.usf.edu/~drohrer/pdfs/Rohrer_et_al_2010JEPLMC.pdf">different material</a>  in one sitting. This technique helps prepare us to use the right strategy for finding the solution to a problem. For example, doing a bunch of division problems in a row means every time we approach a problem, we know it’ll require some division. But doing a series of problems that require multiplication, division, or addition means we have to stop and think about which strategy is best.</p>
