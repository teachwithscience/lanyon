<h2 id="implicit-beliefs">Implicit Beliefs</h2>
<p>What are theseâ€¦</p>
<p>In education, students bring into your classroom many beliefs about the world. Who the best athlete or singer is, what the weather is like in Siberia, the best way to keep up with the Kardashians, etc. These are easy for us to notice, but not too relevant to education (although they make great motivational examples). But students also bring with them a series of implicit beliefs about learning, education, and where they fit into the mix.</p>
<p>Fear of Failure: Dweck, tie with intelligence, or go separate?</p>
<p>Intelligence: entity theory vs. incremental</p>
<p>Thinking is Fun / Thinking is Burdensome: NFC, desire for ease (desirable difficulties and NFC research?)</p>
<p>Comfort with Uncertainty: need for answer, clarity vs. comfort with ambiguity, shades. relates to need for single solution (versus complex) or are they separate?</p>
<p>What is learning? What is the point of school? (job, learn, understand the world? something i have to do? - more like a mix of these, where fall on each / what percentage of each are you feeling right now?</p>
