<p>When there’s a textbook full of equations to memorize, it can be tempting to stay up all night committing them to memory (or trying to). But all-nighters rarely lead to an automatic A—in fact, they’ve been linked to impaired cognitive performance and <a href="http://greatist.com/happiness/tips-sleeping-better/">greater sensitivity to stress</a>. In the days leading up to a big exam, aim to get those seven to nine hours a night so sleep deprivation doesn’t undo all the hard work you’ve put in.</p>

<p>We’ve all been there, facing the siren call of a friend’s Facebook wall on the eve of a giant exam. If a computer’s necessary for studying, try an app (such as <a href="http://selfcontrolapp.com/">this one</a>) that blocks the Internet for a short period of time and see how much more you get done.</p>
<h2 id="move-around.">Move around.</h2>
<p>Research suggests studying the same stuff in a different place every day makes us less likely to forget that information.  Every time we move around (from the library to the coffee shop or the coffee shop to the toilet seat), we force the brain to form new associations with the same material so it becomes a stronger memory.</p>

<p>Don’t stick to one topic; instead, study a bunch of  <a href="http://uweb.cas.usf.edu/~drohrer/pdfs/Rohrer_et_al_2010JEPLMC.pdf">different material</a>  in one sitting. This technique helps prepare us to use the right strategy for finding the solution to a problem. For example, doing a bunch of division problems in a row means every time we approach a problem, we know it’ll require some division. But doing a series of problems that require multiplication, division, or addition means we have to stop and think about which strategy is best.</p>
