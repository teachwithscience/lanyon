<h3 id="convenience-sample">Convenience Sample</h3>
<p>All too typical. Subject pool participants, those who volunteered from an advertisement, finding people in a crowded location to complete a surveyâ€¦</p>
<h3 id="stratified-sample">Stratified Sample</h3>
<p>Using information about the population of interest to ensure a representative sample. Instead of randomly sampling students from a school, use school demographics (such as gender, or race) to define the proportions desired from each to comprise the random sample. Ensures that within the random sample there are no groups of interest (features or possible important differences) that are unbalanced (over or undersampled).</p>
<h3 id="multi-stage-sample-cluster-sampling">Multi-Stage Sample (Cluster Sampling)</h3>
<p>Assumes your data consist of natural levels (hierarchies). i.e. your data are nested within potpulaions (students within classrooms within schools within districts). Essentially a super-stratified sample, ensures representativeness occurrs at more than one level (not just at the student level, but also at the school level, etc.). Allows you to sample at each level of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Highest level grouping (largest) referred to as primary sampling unit (like school district). Next is secondary sampling unit (like school). Then tertiary (like classroom) on down.</p>
