<p>As teachers, we spend an incredible amount of time modifying or adapting curriculum and lesson plans to meet the needs of our learners. Often, this effort involves changing the language, order of presentation, or questions to make them easier. We understand that if something is too complex for our students (too many words not yet in their vocabulary, an overly complex demonstration or lesson, etc.), it may kill their motivation, cause frustration, or make a beautiful lesson plan fail miserably. So, oftentimes we try to make learning easier.</p>
<p>Abundant research exists in support of making learning easier to process for the learner. And this makes sense. If a student cannot understand the words that are coming out of your mouth, or the content of a slide, there is no way they will remember or understand it.
