<h2 id="should-learning-be-hard">Should Learning Be Hard?</h2>
<p>Most people like for things to be easy. While we understand the value of work, and recognize the pride that comes with seeing a challenging project completed, when given a choice, we like the easy way out. Our students agree.</p>
<p>Metacognitive decision for easy road, Yan tendency not to choose hard route.</p>
<p>In fact, scientists have a term for the feeling a student has when learning, it’s called ‘ease of learning.’ We measure EOL by simply asking students, while they are in the process of learning, questions such as ‘how easy is your learning…?’</p>
<p>Yet, despite this desire for learning to be easy, often the best learning comes when the process is difficult. These ‘desirable difficulties’ (Bjork, 1994) are when a context or situation (example?) makes the thing to be learned harder at first, but in the end, ensures the concept or information is easier to recall and apply at a later time. Oddly, the addition of an extra hurdle can improve long-term retention of material, when compared to learning the same thing, but in an easier manner.</p>
<p>Is this just a cruel joke from the universe? Maybe. But it’s a joke we can use to our advantage in the classroom. In fact, scientists have uncovered a whole menagerie of ways we can make learning harder, but in a way that produces better learning in the long run.</p>
<p>\section{Desirable Difficulties}<br>
Here are a rundown of some of the most cited examples of desirable difficulties:</p>
<p>Spacing / Distributed Practice: Spacing learning sessions with gaps in-between, instead cramming (massing), improves learning. [Cepeda, et al, 2006; Baddeley &amp; Longman, 1978; Dempster, 1990]</p>
<p>Interleaving: Mixing up the order in which problems or topics are presented, instead of logically blocking them together, aids the learning of each. [Kornell &amp; Bjork, 2008; Gagne, Geraci &amp; Roediger, 2008; Tohrer &amp; Taylor, 2007]</p>
<p>Testing / Retrieval Practice: Trying to come up with the answer to a question, or summarizing what you just read, or attempting to pull up from memory what you learned last week without the use of aids or cues (or limited cues) enhances learning. [Roediger &amp; Karpicke, 2006]</p>
<p>Generation: Making students generate answers to questions or material, instead of giving them the answer at the start, adds to learning. [deWinstanley &amp; Bjork, 2004; Kapur, 2012?]</p>
<p>Disorganized Topics: Forcing students to find connections and relationships on their own (within limits, and assuming proper background knowledge exists), beats presenting topics in a logical sequence. [McNamara et al, 1996]</p>
<p>Disfluency: Altering content to force students to process the information in an unusual way (hard to read, but legible, font) can lead to deeper processing of the material and stronger learning gains. [Diemand-Yauman, Oppenheimer, &amp; Vaughn, ???]</p>
<p>Pre-Testing: look in the Roediger book for more…</p>
<p>Delayed Feedback: Sometimes, giving feedback after a delay, but not so far students have forgotten their work, can give them more time to process the feedback, producing more learning than instant feedback. [??]</p>
<p>In education research, we love to have different names for the same idea. Hooray for confusion! Though maybe this is a desirable difficulty… Either way, to learn more about these topics, check out the articles cited here, search the words in your favorite search engine,</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-these">How to Use These</h2>
<p>Many of these simply involve making the learning format unpredictable. Whether changing the anticipated order (interleaving, disorganized topics), making something harder to read (disfluency), or adding variability (interleaving, changing the setting or task slightly), turning on a student’s brain with slight changes can be an inexpensive way to enhance their learning. (Within limits, of course).</p>
<p>Further questions for yourself and researchers:<br>
Can we combine desirable difficulties? If so, what happens?</p>
