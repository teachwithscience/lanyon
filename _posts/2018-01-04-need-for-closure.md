<p>Does not having a clear answer bother you? Do you hate when a movie ends without a resolution? Then you might have a high need for closure?</p>
<p>Similar to a personality trait, people tend to fall somewhere on a spectrum from low to high need for cognitive closure. Those low in this trait are typically okay with answers that are in shades of grey. Answers that include ‘it depends’ and endings with ambiguity do not ruffle their feathers. On the opposite end, those high in need for closure are uncomfortable with uncertainty. They prefer ‘black and white’ answers with clear lines. A good story or movie ends with an ending where everything is explained and when making decisions, they are often quick to arrive at one. In more precise terms, those high in need for closure desire secure and stable knowledge.</p>
<p>While these individual differences may be amusing when it comes to watching a movie or buying dinner with someone on the opposite end of the scale as you, they matter in the classroom, as well. Much of human knowledge is well-documented and known, but often full of nuance and probabilities surrounding the knowledge. Some facts are straightforward and clear, but complex topics (advanced mathematics), those dealing with social history or policy (what should ____ have done? or what should we do about ____?), and often how to approach a problem on an exam all have a level of uncertainty in them.</p>
<p>Being uncomfortable with these topics sitting in limbo can lead to rash decision-making and undesirable outcomes. Students can choose a path to solve a problem too hastily or far too quickly make a judgment on an issue. Further, once they have arrived at a decision, those high in need for closure are hard to budge. In school, this can make it hard to correct misconceptions, a challenge to teach topics with different possible outcomes / angles, and may even cause issues with social interactions.</p>

<p>Currently, most researchers use a 15 item scale, known as the short-form version of the original 40+ item scale by Arie Kruglanski &amp; Donna Webster (199?). The current version was developed in 2011 by Arne Roots &amp; Alan Van Hiel and includes questions such as:</p>
