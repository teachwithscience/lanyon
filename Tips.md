<p>A learning technique called “<a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2009/11/spaced-education-boosts-learning">spaced repetition</a>” involves breaking up information into small chunks and reviewing them consistently over a long period of time. So don’t try to memorize the entire periodic table in one sitting—instead learn a few rows every day and review each lesson before starting anything new.</p>

<p>Turning the details you need to remember into a <a href="http://greatist.com/happiness/remember-everything/">crazy story</a>  helps make the information more meaningful. For example, remember the order of mathematic operations <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html">PEMDAS</a>  this way: Philip (‘P’) wanted to eat (‘E’) his friend Mary (‘M’) but he died (‘D’) from arsenic (‘AS’) poisoning.</p>

<p>Quizzing ourselves may be one of the best ways to prepare for the real deal.  And don’t worry about breaking a sweat while trying to remember the name of the 37th U.S. president (fyi, it’s Nixon): The harder it is to remember a piece of information in practice mode, the more likely we are to remember it in the future.</p>
